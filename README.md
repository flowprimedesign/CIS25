# CIS25 - C++ Programming Exercises

_Author: Luis Ibarra_

This repository contains my solutions to weekly C++ programming exercises for my Computer Science class, **CIS25**. Each week, a new folder (e.g., `week1`, `week2`, etc.) will be added with that week's set of `.cpp` exercises.

## Week 2 Exercises

| File Name             | Problem Name / Description                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pointers_memory.cpp` | **Pointers and Memory Management**<br>Uses pointers and dynamic memory allocation to manage an array of Student structs with binary search functionality. |
| `strings_classes.cpp` | **Strings and Classes**<br>Demonstrates class usage with file I/O operations, including saving and loading Item data to/from files.                       |
| `object.cpp`          | **OOP and Inheritance**<br>Implements inheritance with a base Item class and derived Perishable/NonPerishable classes using polymorphism.                 |


## Structure

- Each week will have its own folder (e.g., `week1/`, `week2/`, ...).
- Each `.cpp` file is a self-contained program for a specific exercise.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired week's folder.
3. Compile any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler, for example:
   ```sh
   g++ hello_inventory.cpp -o hello_inventory
   ./hello_inventory
   ```
